Is this 
the 
real 
life?
Is this 
just 
fantasy?
Caught 
in a 
landside
,
No 
escape 
from 
reality
Open 
your 
eyes,
Look up 
to the 
skies 
and see,
I'm 
just a 
poor 
boy, I 
need no 
sympathy
,
Because 
I'm 
easy 
come, 
easy go,
Little 
high, 
little 
low,
Any way 
the 
wind 
blows 
doesn't 
really 
matter 
to
Me, to 
me

Mamaaa,
Just 
killed 
a man,
Put a 
gun 
against 
his 
head, 
pulled 
my 
trigger,
Now 
he's 
dead
Mamaaa, 
life 
had 
just 
begun,
But now 
I've 
gone 
and 
thrown 
it all 
away
Mama, 
oooh,
Didn't 
mean to 
make 
you cry,
If I'm 
not 
back 
again 
this 
time 
tomorrow
,
Carry 
on, 
carry 
on as 
if 
nothing 
really 
matters

Too 
late, 
my time 
has 
come,
Sends 
shivers 
down my 
spine, 
body's 
aching 
all
The time
Goodbye,
 
everybod
y, I've 
got to 
go,
Gotta 
leave 
you all 
behind 
and 
face 
the 
truth
Mama, 
oooh
I don't 
want to 
die,
I 
sometime
s wish 
I'd 
never 
been 
born at 
all.

I see a 
little 
silhouet
to of a 
man,
Scaramou
ch, 
Scaramou
ch, 
will 
you do 
the 
Fandango
!

I'm 
just a 
poor 
boy 
nobody 
loves me
He's 
just a 
poor 
boy 
from a 
poor 
family,
Spare 
him his 
life 
from 
this 
monstros
ity
Easy 
come, 
easy 
go, 
will 
you let 
me go
Bismilla
h! No, 
we will 
not let 
you go
(Let 
him 
go!) 
Bismilla
h! We 
will 
not let 
you go
(Let 
him 
go!) 
Bismilla
h! We 
will 
not let 
you go
(Let me 
go) 
Will 
not let 
you go
(Let me 
go)(Neve
r) 
Never 
let you 
go
(Let me 
go) 
(Never) 
let you 
go (Let 
me go) 
Ah
No, no, 
no, no, 
no, no, 
no
Oh mama 
mia, 
mama 
mia, 
mama 
mia, 
let me 
go

devil 
put 
aside 
for me, 
for me,
For meee

So you 
think 
you can 
stop me 
and 
spit in 
my eye
So you 
think 
you can 
love me 
and 
leave 
me to 
die
Oh, 
baby, 
can't 
do this 
to me, 
baby,
Just 
gotta 
get 
out, 
just 
gotta 
get 
right 
outta 
here

Nothing 
really 
matters,
 Anyone 
can see,
Nothing 
really 
matters,
Nothing 
really 
matters 
to me
Any way 
the 
wind 
blows...

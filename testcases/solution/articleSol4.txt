ANTHO

JOHNS
ON: 
Yeah,
 
David
, 
can 
you 
belie
ve 
it? 
Now, 
this 
time 
last 
year,
 
offic
ials 
here 
in 
New 
Jerse
y 
had 
gotte
n 
word 
about
 
what 
was 
takin
g 
place
 in 
New 
York 
City.
 
They 
knew 
it 
would
 be 
a 
matte
r of 
days 
befor
e it 
cross
ed 
the 
Hudso
n 
River
, 
and 
it 
did. 
One 
year 
ago 
today
, a 
perso
n 
that 
lives
 
here 
in 
Fort 
Lee 
worke
d in 
New 
York 
City.
 He 
came 
back 
over 
here.
 He 
was 
the 
first
 
case 
here 
in 
the 
state
 of 
New 
Jerse
y.

On 
that 
day, 
the 
healt
h 
offic
er 
here 
in 
Fort 
Lee 
had 
just 
start
ed 
her 
job. 
And 
yes, 
what 
a 
year 
it 
has 
been.

A 
year 
ago, 
there
 was 
a 
rush 
to 
get 
as 
much 
infor
matio
n as 
possi
ble 
about
 the 
virus
. 
The 
first
 
patie
nt 
lived
 in 
a 
first
 
floor
 
apart
ment 
here 
in 
Fort 
Lee 
but 
had 
worke
d in 
the 
city 
and 
cross
ed 
the 
Georg
e 
Washi
ngton
 
Bridg
e to 
get 
back 
and 
forth
. 
Withi
n 
days,
 the 
towns
hip 
of 
Teane
ck 
took 
a 
drast
ic 
step 
to 
shut 
down 
every
thing
 
becau
se 
it 
becam
e 
groun
d 
zero 
for 
COVID
-19. 
Now 
leade
rs 
are 
recal
ling 
the 
year 
that 
chang
ed 
every
thing
.

DEAN 
KAZIN
CI: 
It 
conce
rned 
me. 
This 
was 
a 
globa
l 
probl
em. 
And 
again
, it 
was 
migra
ting 
to 
our 
area.
 And 
there
 
were 
a 
lot 
of 
quest
ions.
 
Resid
ents 
were 
very 
conce
rned.

ANTHO
NY 
JOHNS
ON: 
Soon,
 the 
entir
e 
state
 
follo
wed 
with 
the 
lockd
owns.
 
Schoo
ls 
were 
shut 
down.
 And 
place
s 
that 
had 
been 
vibra
nt 
turne
d 
into 
ghost
 
towns
. 
When 
leade
rs 
met 
here 
in 
Fort 
Lee 
to 
discu
ss 
the 
first
 
case,
 no 
one 
had 
on a 
mask.
 A 
year 
later
, a 
mask 
is 
norma
l 
attir
e.

JIM 
TEDES
CO: 
I 
wish 
we 
would
 
have 
been 
able 
to 
do 
more.

ANTHO
NY 
JOHNS
ON: 
Today
, 
some 
2,600
 
resid
ents 
of 
Berge
n 
Count
y 
have 
died.
 
Over 
21,00
0 in 
the 
state
 
have 
lost 
their
 
lives
 to 
COVID
-19. 
This 
is a 
sad 
anniv
ersar
y.

JIM 
TEDES
CO: 
The 
peopl
e 
calli
ng 
me 
and 
telli
ng 
me 
about
 
their
 
loved
 
ones 
that 
had 
got 
COVID
 and 
passe
d 
away.
 And 
can 
we 
help?
 
What 
can 
I do 
to 
do 
more?
 And 
those
 
kind 
of 
thing
s, 
those
 are 
the 
thing
s 
that 
will 
stay 
with 
me 
forev
er.

ANTHO
NY 
JOHNS
ON: 
But 
now 
there
's a 
littl
e 
light
 at 
the 
end 
of 
this 
year-
long 
strug
gle, 
with 
more 
vacci
nes 
and 
bette
r 
treat
ment.
 A 
year 
later
, 
there
 is 
some 
optim
ism 
that 
a 
new 
norma
l is 
close
 at 
hand.

- 
We're
 
going
 to 
conti
nue 
to 
open 
up. 
And 
we're
 
going
 to 
get 
to, 
I 
belie
ve, 
a 
much 
more 
norma
l 
summe
r on 
the 
shore
.

ANTHO
NY 
JOHNS
ON: 
Yeah,
 the 
gover
nor 
even 
sugge
sted 
we 
might
 get 
to a 
point
 in 
open 
space
s 
where
 you 
do 
have 
room,
 you 
might
 be 
able 
to 
even 
take 
off 
your 
mask 
if 
you'v
e 
had 
the 
vacci
ne. 
But 
he 
still
 
says 
he 
suspe
cts 
that 
you'l
l 
need 
to 
keep 
the 
mask 
on 
if 
you'r
e in 
close
, 
tight
 
quart
ers 
becau
se 
you'r
e 
never
 
sure 
if 
other
s 
have 
gotte
n 
the 
vacci
ne. 
And 
it'll
 be 
good 
for 
your 
own 
safet
y.

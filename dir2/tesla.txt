Musk said on Twitter this past weekend version 8.2 doubles access to the FSD beta and promised beta version 8.3 will "probably" be 10 times the current size. He also warned people to "be careful" as the system is still "getting mature." Indeed, we took a look at the system when it began trickling out to remind everyone that autonomous cars do not exist today, despite the cool tricks FSD has up its sleeve.

After the CEO's initial tweet on Friday, he followed up Saturday saying the company saw "high levels of demand" and promised to add a "Download Beta" button to the service folder of compatible Teslas in the next 10 days. It's not clear if the button will automatically grant access, or if it puts owners on some sort of digital wait list as Tesla prepares to expand the software beta further. Tesla does not operate a public relations department to field requests for comment.
